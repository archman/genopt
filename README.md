General multi-dimensional optimization package developed by Python,
integrating the core optimization algorithms provided by ``DAKOTA``.

Packages required:

* ``DAKOTA`` (v6.4)
* ``openmpi`` (v2.0.1)
* ``Python`` (2.7.12)

Extra Python packages required:

* ``numpy`` (v1.11.1)
* ``matplotlib`` (v1.5.1)
* ``flame``

Recently, supported optimization drivers are:
  
* ``flamedriver_oc``, orbit correction engine built with core library of ``flame``;

Drivers are built from another repo: [optdrivers](https://github.com/archman/optdrivers)
